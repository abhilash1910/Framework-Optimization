## Distributed Framework Optimization - Data Hack Summit 2023

Deep Learning Frameworks form the baseline over which millions of models (LLMs, multimodals , auto regressive) are being compiled and built on.
Many of these frameworks require sophisticated optimization to make models train and infer faster in constrained hardware chips. The intrinsic kernels which form a part of these Frameworks (such as Pytorch) leverage profound adaptive features to help break perf- benchmarks in supercomputing and federated deep learning . This is a glimpse of different sub-kernel, intermediate framework and superficial model optimization techniques which help people run large models such as GPTs on constrained environments and clusters.
